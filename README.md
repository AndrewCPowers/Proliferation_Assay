# Proliferation_Assay
A couple of my undergrads performed a Proliferation Assay. I designed this code to average them, find the standard deviation for all of the points and then plot them. I plotted it into a scatter plot, I added a line plot, and error bars. I want help to know how I can cut this code down.
