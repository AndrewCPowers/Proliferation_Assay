# Proliferation_Assay
A couple of my undergrads performed a Proliferation Assay. I designed this code to average them, find the standard deviation for all of the points and then plot them. I plotted it into a scatter plot, I added a line plot, and error bars. I want help to know how I can cut this code down.

It is pretty simple I took 4 data points over 4 times periods. Day0, Day1, Day2, and Day3. I have 3 samples. A Control, and two samples I want to test against the control. So for an exmaple I took the Day0 data for the Control. I have 4 data points, 
'Day0': [0.642,0.282,0.261,0.833]
I averaged these, and also found there standard deviation. 

I did this for all 4 days and all 3 sample types. 

Then I took this data and plotted it.

I just want to know how to clean up the code and make it more efficient. Thank you for your help!
